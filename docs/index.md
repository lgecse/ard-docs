# Agentic Resource Discovery Specification

The **Agentic Resource Discovery Specification (ARDS)** is an open standard for discovering **agentic resources** — the tools, Skills, MCP servers, APIs, workflows, and agents that extend an AI client. It pins down how an agentic resource describes itself and how a client asks *"what can help with this task?"*, so any compliant discovery service can answer for any client.

## Why ARDS?

An agentic resource no one can find is an agentic resource no one can use. Wiring agentic resources in by hand works for a handful of well-known tools; it breaks down once every product, team, and vendor is publishing its own. Even with basic search, stuffing thousands of schemas into the context window degrades both accuracy and latency. ARDS moves discovery out of the prompt and into a service the client asks — the step that turned a web of bookmarks into web search.

### What an AI client should be able to do
1.  **Global access** — reach the world's growing catalog of agentic resources, not just what was wired up in advance.
2.  **Zero prompt bloat** — keep the active toolset minimal so the context window stays clear.
3.  **Discovery at scale** — find the exact agentic resource for a task out of millions.
4.  **Decentralized trust** — establish cryptographic trust in authors and sources.
5.  **Runtime use** — discover, connect to, and invoke agentic resources dynamically, at the moment of need.

### What ARDS enables
*   **🔌 Composable discovery services** — stand up a discovery service over any kind of agentic resource (MCP, Skills, A2A, custom APIs), public or private, and compose it with others.
*   **🌐 Self-sovereign publishing** — host a standard `ai-catalog.json` at your own domain's `/.well-known/` to advertise your agentic resources.
*   **⚡ Cross-client portability** — let any client from any harness discover, verify, and use your agentic resources.

## Quick preview

Here is how a publisher advertises an MCP server using the standard `ai-catalog.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Acme AI",
    "identifier": "did:web:acme.com"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:ai:acme.com:agent:trading",
      "displayName": "Finance Trading Agent",
      "type": "application/mcp-server+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme.com/agent.json",
      "representativeQueries": [
        "analyze market trend for 2026"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
